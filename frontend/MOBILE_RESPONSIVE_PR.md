# Mobile Responsive Implementation - PR Summary

## Overview
This PR implements mobile-responsive design for TheNeural website while maintaining desktop functionality unchanged. The implementation uses React hooks for responsive behavior and includes automatic mobile issue detection and reporting.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/`)
- **`useWindowSize.ts`**: SSR-safe hook for tracking window dimensions
- **`useIsMobile.ts`**: Convenience hook for mobile detection (default breakpoint: <768px)

### 2. Mobile Issue Reporting (`frontend/src/utils/`)
- **`mobileReporting.ts`**: Utility functions for detecting and reporting mobile layout issues
- **`frontend/app/api/webhooks/mobile-issue/route.ts`**: Webhook endpoint for receiving mobile issue reports

### 3. Mobile-Responsive Components
Updated `frontend/app/page.tsx` with mobile-specific layouts:

#### Header Navigation
- **Desktop**: Unchanged original navigation
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu with dropdown navigation
- **Mobile**: Proper tap targets and touch-friendly interface

#### Hero Section
- **Desktop**: Unchanged side-by-side layout
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with adjusted spacing and text sizes
- **Mobile**: Responsive logo and image sizing

#### Story Cards
- **Desktop**: Original pill-shaped cards (rounded-[200px])
- **Mobile**: Smaller border radius (rounded-3xl) for better mobile appearance
- **Mobile**: Adjusted padding and text sizes

#### Team Section
- **Desktop**: Four-column grid layout
- **Mobile**: Single column with smaller profile images
- **Mobile**: Adjusted text sizes for readability

#### Activities Section
- **Desktop**: Two-column grid with pill-shaped cards
- **Mobile**: Single column with rounded-3xl cards
- **Mobile**: Responsive text and icon sizing

#### Newsletter/CTA Section
- **Desktop**: Side-by-side input and button
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with full-width elements
- **Mobile**: Proper tap targets for form elements

### 4. Mobile-Specific CSS (`frontend/app/globals.css`)
- Mobile container padding adjustments
- Minimum tap target sizes (44px)
- Mobile menu animations
- Horizontal scroll prevention
- Mobile-friendly hover effects

## Key Features

### SSR-Safe Implementation
- All hooks check for `typeof window === 'undefined'` to prevent hydration mismatches
- Proper fallback values for server-side rendering

### Desktop Preservation
- Desktop layout (≥1024px) remains pixel-identical to original
- All desktop animations and interactions preserved
- No changes to desktop CSS classes or markup

### Mobile Issue Detection
- Automatic detection of horizontal overflow
- Detection of small tap targets
- Automatic reporting via webhook endpoint
- Manual issue reporting capability

### Performance Optimized
- Mobile animations simplified for better performance
- Responsive images with appropriate sizing
- Efficient hook implementations

## Testing

### Test Plan

- 414×896 (large phone)
- 768×1024 (tablet)

### Browser Support
